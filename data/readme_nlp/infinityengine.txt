files help translators context strings translating leading translations mod contents easier validate leading install crashes weidu mods built portability call shell scripts bat files julia contains functions speed changes computed single execution program rewrites dialogtlk total quadratic complexity easier inclusion mod metadata automatic mod conflict detection current status limited core set features loading resources translating strings etc advanced testing items dialogs currently available module currently load display limits edit module core stabilized adding resource types relatively simple currently limited bgee bgee eet games adding support ie games term goal design goals design goals include roughly decreasing priority userfriendliness cli style prevent user learn adhoc languages tp frankly esoteric instead single purpose language simple learn loads documentation exist module tries hard abstract game ugliest usermod author objects properties represented plain julia structs item swh bastard sword minstrength abilities damage crushing d nonsense syntax help writing efficient robust code requiring frequent iesdp documentation moreover references game objects swh namespaced prevent mod interference requiring byte author prefixes namespaces transparent mod authors explained detail relevant documentation finally mods julia programs ideally ease development testing validation release robustness module tries depthview game structures means checks easy implement missing resources missing translated strings etc using real programming language means syntax easy validate hand module initial author weidu mods crash install missing tilde released translation files happen counting utfrelated errors portability julia portable platforms able run ie games code kept portable basic precautions joinpath instead using slashes using assumptions symlinks etc particular tool currently developed unix care filenames sensitivity ideally able run mods ugly solution ciopfs separate ntfs partition help speed mods require shell scripts batch files julia contains basic shell functions mv mkdir etc allowing write scripts selfsupporting portable mod stack management project able manage set mods including files replaced mods enable automatic detection conflicts optimistically finegrain conflict detection example mods overwrite object property table entry dialog hand weidu mods stand conflict detection performed mods current status project code managing weidu mod stack basically commandline equivalent bigworldsetup etc unreleased significant code reused speed minor goal installing stack weidu mods hours finetuning single mod crucially depends speed installing mod julia fast language assembly code generator whereas weidu scripting language call local shell scripts etc weidu mod standalone program huge files namely dialogtlk rewritten times tiny changes leading quadratic complexity infinityexplorer written java hence slow currently module load unmodded game data negligible time julia started milliseconds typical laptop mods particularly translate language mods scs speed readability gains consequent dialogs module defines julia syntax ie dialogs goal simpler mod authors weidu syntax writing parser using julia instead feature list summed userfriendly weidu define dialogue single file instead tra inline strings using proper translation formats po appropriate editing tools exist allow simple modify dialogues la weidu chain prevent namespace conflicts requiring prefixes solving resref machinery user intervention bit weidu strref userfriendly short example syntax namely imoen dialog bg prologue following code actually decompiled game data actor imoen trigger numberoftimestalkedto surprised stuffy ol gorion transitions reply afraid chat little journal friend imoen pestered trigger reactionltlasttalkedtobyneutrallower reply sorry child tell syntax roughly stabilized details vary simple features implemented extending dialogs inserting transitions significant remains quest management handling strref actions translations using standard po files complete makes easier translate mods using existing tools system robust partial somewhat obsolete translations remain usable syntax errors translation files cause mod crash moreover translation system able include context translated strings mod author include context manually module tries
