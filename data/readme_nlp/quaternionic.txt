quaternionic quaternions julia installation using pkg pkg add quaternionic usage documentation details motivation goal project build complete quaternion type julia features consider fairly basic quaternion package including subtypes rotors purevector quaternions corresponding specialized methods numerous conversions representations quaternions represent especially rotations smooth interpolation differentation interpolant intelligent handling distance measures construction random quaternions various special types enabling efficient integration angular velocity construction minimal rotation documentation thorough testing wide variety implementations quaternions julia none tick boxes none easy extend particular popular design choices conflict plenty experience programming quaternions including popular python package fancier package experience julia project particular understanding geometric algebra coded experimenting subtypes static arrays imagine hardcoding components experimenting rewrite hopefully invisible us
