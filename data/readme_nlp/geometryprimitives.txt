geometryprimitives package provides set geometric primitive types balls cuboids cylinders operations designed enable piecewise definition functions especially finitedifference finiteelement simulations julia language example suppose discretizing pde poisson equation provide simple user interface user specify function applications piecewise constant able specify box cylinders etcetera geometryprimitives package allows user provide list shapes associated data value define furthermore application discretized simulations imposes couple additional requirements able evaluate huge times grid provide fast log tree data structure rapid searching shapes compute average voxel provide routines rapid approximate voxel averages value normal vector nearest shape provide normalvector computation package inspired geometry utilities steven johnson libctl packag
