bitintegers package implements fixed width integer types similar standard builtin ones int uint following obvious meaning exported string macros construct instantiate pair define integers macro julia myint myuint named type lower implemented using primitive intrinsics caveat legal versions primes factor rand llvm abort program fine couple outstanding issues division operations fail widths bits via conversion bigint makes slow slightly recent nightly pre prints jit session error symbols found divei doesn prior version reason importing code invalidates precompiled functions base repl experience annoyingly recompiled julialang creating arrays size power easily leads errors segfaults
