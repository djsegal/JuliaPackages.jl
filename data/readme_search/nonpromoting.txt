nonpromoting julia library promoting type wrappers arithmetic types automatically promoted help prevent subtle errors overview sometimes automatic promotion subtly wrong especially precision float default floating generated example course code simple spot multiple modules involved spotting isn easy function plus tenth bad highly accurate unintentionally inaccurate expression bigfloat error difficult mentioned explicitly happens chooses dividing integers version infinitely rational represent fraction arbitrarily converted avoid surprises avoiding compiler refuses quickly detected design module defines wrapper expected subtype abstractfloat etc supports operations except rules disabled efficient setup zero run time overhead value promotable call constructor extract convert usual add subtract multiply square root trigonometric functions supported directly looks using reported produce addition defined promote explicit correctly accurately basic idea instead interface
