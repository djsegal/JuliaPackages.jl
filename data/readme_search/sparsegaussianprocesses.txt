sparsegaussianprocesses package implements sparse gaussian processes models using doubly stochastic variational inference unlike essentially process packages means covariances instead path wise sampling technique implement entire function draws posteriors evaluated deterministically arbitrary locations sampled supports form lambda epsilon sigma inter domain operators identity gradient convolutional patch map little formula defines precisely correct mean variance standard features following planned evaluation posterior sample paths differentiable assuming sufficiently smooth kernel strong support including training gpu vector valued euclidean domains examples set available folder contributing development contributions welcome touch regarding julia slack citing article wilson author james viacheslav borovitskiy alexander terenin peter mostowski marc deisenroth journal arxiv title efficiently functions
