irrationalexpressions julia module makes expressions behave irrational float constants arbitrary precision packages bigfloat provide conversion methods yield desired arithmetic operation happens defaults typeof lead subtle bugs example correct decimal written solution using operations don immediately force instead expression kept unevaluated target type supported currently downconversion occurs floating value encountered resulting functions base typically convert encountering unknown subtype real usual cos ans types integer rational build care floats accidentally created irrationalexpr explicitly support abstractfloat conversions promotion automatically caveat quick hack simplification elimination common subexpressions inadvertently loop grow exponentially global entering list blowing minimum size tracked error thrown extend sqrt etc complex valued missing
