<p dir="auto">Recruiter is an optional service that enables small communities to organise recruitment of new members to PeaceFounder. An email is used for identification mechanisms and confidential channels to which a deme registration invite is sent. That is then pasted into the PeaceFounder application on a local device, ensuring correct private key generation and registration to the braidchain to become a fully functional member.</p>

<p dir="auto">To use the Recruiter, you first need to set up a PeaceFounder deme with a recruiter (done by default), from which you need to obtain the:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A <code>KEY</code> and a <code>HASH</code> function are used for authorisation operations</li>
<li>The internet location <code>URL</code> to the deme</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The second ingredient is an SMTP service which enables to send off emails by a trusted email provider. Unfortunately, many popular email providers like GMAIL, Outlook and others have discontinued their SMTP services in the name of two-factor authentification. Those who still do support SMTP tend to be outcasted as junk when BIG providers receive emails from them. Thus getting SMTP can take a little bit of research to work. The ingredients you need explicitly are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>SMTP service location like <code>smtps://mail.inbox.lv:465</code></li>
<li>Email address and password</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">It is fine to host the Recruiter on a dynamic IP address without a certificate as long as the information provided in the form plus the IP address is not considered sensitive or attainable to a potential eavesdropper. Nevertheless, you may opt for an SSL certificate to avoid scaring users away when the browser informs them that the site is unsecured.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is also no need to have a confidential connection with the deme server as the token is computed with the <code>KEY</code> at both endpoints without ever being transmitted.</p>

<p dir="auto">It is fairly possible that there already is a protocol specification which uses HMAC in the same way as I have done so. It would be great then to comply with the specification to analyse implementation easier.</p>
