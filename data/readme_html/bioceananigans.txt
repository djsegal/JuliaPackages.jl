<p dir="auto">There are many different ways to discretize relationships between different biogeochemical tracers in the ocean. One of those ways is the system of ordinary differential equations that is often called <strong>N</strong>utrient-<strong>P</strong>hytoplankton-<strong>Z</strong>ooplankton(-<strong>D</strong>etritus) set of models. Despite <em>simple</em>, these models could give insights about interelationships and biophysical interactions in ocean ecossystems across scales, from submesoscale to climate predictions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most of the applications of these set of models are either <em>offline</em> to the physical part or intrinsic to the physical model infrastructure, usually written in FORTRAN language. This creates a problem because users many times doesn't understand well which equations are solved and cannot easily adapt to the set of equations they want to reproduce.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl">Oceananigans.jl</a> is a very nice example on how numerical models could be <strong>easy to use and adapt</strong> without loosing the understanding behind the code. The usage of this physical ocean model is the closest to the human language that doesn't cross the black-box domain. Following the same principles of having something <strong>as readable and configurable as possible</strong>, this repository aims to basically create a set of modules and functions that are the essentials for building <strong>NPZD models</strong> and its derivatives on Oceananigans.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most of the interelationships between biogeochemical tracers could be implemented using the <strong>forcing functions</strong> (see <a href="https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/generated/convecting_plankton/" rel="nofollow">Convecting Plankton</a>  example from Oceananigans documentation), but commonly the light or light-limiting growth of the phytoplankton are <strong>averaged over the mixed layer</strong> in order to parameterized the effects of the mixing in the upper boundary layer. In other words, the mixing timescale is usually longer than photosynthesis, but shorter than cell-division time, which makes phytoplankton <strong>see the average light or grow at the average light-limiting growth rate</strong> while on the mixed layer. Other example of processes that are not easily implemented on Oceananigans include the <strong>shading of phytoplankton</strong> to deeper layers and the <strong>sinking velocity</strong>. The latter is currently being implemented on Oceananigans by this <a href="https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2389" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2389/hovercard">Pull Request</a> with a new forcing called <code>AdvectiveForcing</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For now, this repository basically gives a set of modules that can be used to estimate the mixed-layer depth, estimate the phytoplankton shading and calculate the light-limiting growth, which is defined by the user as a function, and then the light (or the light-limiting growth) can be averaged over the mixed layer.</p>
