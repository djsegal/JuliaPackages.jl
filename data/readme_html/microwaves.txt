<p>This package is ultimately intended to provide a library of functions useful
for RF and microwave engineering. Currently, the main feature being
implemented is a touchstone file reader and plotting recipes for the read
data.</p>
<p>There is currently a semi-functional reader named <code>read_touchstone()</code>,
however this does not work for all touchstone files, and it will be
superseded soon by interfacing with FileIO so users can simply call <code>load()</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, functionality for network manipulation and basic network
synthesis is planned. Any other useful ideas/features people can come up
with are more than welcome as well.</p>
<p>If it is not apparent, this package is in the early stages of its development
and its API should not be considered stable.</p>
