<p>ProgressiveHedging.jl makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl">JuMP</a> framework to build and solve the subproblems.  It can be used with Julia's Distributed package to solve problems in parallel.</p>
<p>Users pass a function that builds a JuMP model along with a scenario tree and a dictionary identifying the variables in each stage.</p>
<p>Examples written in a Jupyter notebook may be found in the Examples directory.</p>
