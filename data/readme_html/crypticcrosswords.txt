<p dir="auto">This package implements a fully automated solver for cryptic crossword clues in the Julia programming language. It works by building up a formal context-free grammar describing the way cryptic clues tend to be structured, then parsing the given clue using that grammar. Each valid parse is solved and checked to see if it produces a coherent wordplay and definition.</p>
<p dir="auto">This package was adapted from my prior work in Python, which can still be found at <a href="https://github.com/rdeits/cryptics">https://github.com/rdeits/cryptics</a> . The Julia implementation is significantly more powerful and flexible, as it also includes a custom chart parser (powered by <a href="https://github.com/rdeits/ChartParsers.jl">ChartParsers.jl</a>) with support for probabilistic grammars. As a result, the Julia implementation can consistently handle longer clues which would have completely stumped the older Python version.</p>

the 12Dics package which is in the public domain.</p>
