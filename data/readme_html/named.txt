it is often handy to have data structures that can be efficiently indexed
by position (like a vector) as well as readably indexed by name (like a
hash table). The NamedIndex type here maps unique names to integer
indexes, looking up ByteString indexes in a Dict and passing other
index types through. The NamedVector type implements a simple use case,
with a backing vector of an arbitrary type.</p>
