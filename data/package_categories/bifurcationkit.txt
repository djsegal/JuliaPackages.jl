[["Physics", "Laser Physics", 3, "The readme file indicates that this package is used for bifurcation analysis of equations F(u, \u03bb) = 0, where \u03bb\u2208\u211d. This can be related to Laser Physics, but not with extreme confidence."], ["Mathematics", "Numerical Analysis", 5, "This package is focused on performing automatic bifurcation analysis and continuation algorithms which are based on Newton-Krylov methods, making it highly relevant to numerical analysis."]]
